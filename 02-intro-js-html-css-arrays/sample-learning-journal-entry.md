## Learning Journal Day 2

Today we learned about arrays and array methods. I feel okay with `.length` and `.push()` but need to review the other methods more.

We also talked about if/else conditionals. These don't make any sense to me at all. Looks like I'll be reading the textbook again to get a better handle on it.

On the plus side, my first lab was graded and I got all 10 points! It's been a tough few days already but I'm enjoying the process and seeing my hard work pay off.
